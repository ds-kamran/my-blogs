**Docker Volume:** In Docker, a volume is a way to persistently store data generated by and used by Docker containers. Volumes provide a means to share and manage data between containers or between a container and the host system.

Volumes in Docker are created using the `docker volume` command or can be specified in a `docker-compose.yml` file if you're using Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications.

This command creates a volume named `mydata` and then starts a container using that volume, mounting it to a specific path within the container (`/path/in/container`). This allows the container to read and write data to `mydata`, which persists beyond the container's lifecycle.

Volumes play a crucial role in Docker when it comes to managing and persisting data used by containers, providing flexibility and ease in handling data in containerized environments.

**Docker network:**

Docker networks provide a way for Docker containers to communicate with each other and with the outside world, enabling efficient networking between containers running on the same Docker host or across different hosts.

There are different types of Docker networks:

1. **Bridge Networks:** This is the default network created when you install Docker. Containers within a bridge network can communicate with each other using container names as DNS names. Containers on the same bridge network can communicate directly, while external access can be controlled through port mapping.
    
2. **Host Networks:** When using the host network mode, a container shares the network namespace with the Docker host, effectively bypassing Docker's network abstraction. This can offer better performance since it doesn't involve additional NAT (Network Address Translation) but can limit isolation.
    
3. **Overlay Networks:** Overlay networks facilitate communication between containers running on different Docker hosts. They use the overlay driver and are often used in swarm mode, Docker's native clustering and orchestration solution, to connect containers across multiple hosts.
    
4. **Macvlan Networks:** These networks give containers a MAC address from the underlying physical network, making containers appear as physical devices on the network. This allows containers to be directly addressed by other devices on the network.
    

When you create a Docker network, containers can be attached to that network, allowing them to communicate directly by using container names as hostnames. You can also control how containers on different networks communicate with each other, setting up rules for network access and traffic.

**TASK 01: Create a multi-container docker-compose file which will bring *UP* and bring *DOWN* containers in a single shot ( Example - Create application and database container )**

Note :  
version : should be the latest version of docker-compose  
Context : is tho indicate the location of docker file.

TASK 2:

* Learn how to use Docker Volumes and Named Volumes to share files and directories between multiple containers.

* Create two or more containers that read and write data to the same volume using the `docker run --mount` command.
    
* Container 01 :
    
* To make use of the volume, we’ll create a new container from the Ubuntu image, using the `--rm` flag to automatically delete it when we exit. We’ll also use `-v` to mount the new volume. `-v` requires the name of the volume, a colon, then the absolute path to where the volume should appear inside the container.`-t` will give us a terminal, and `-i` will allow us to interact with it. For clarity, we’ll use `--name` to identify the container.

    Verify that the data is the same in all containers by using the docker exec command to run commands inside each container.

* Use the docker volume ls command to list all volumes and docker volume rm command to remove the volume when you're done.
